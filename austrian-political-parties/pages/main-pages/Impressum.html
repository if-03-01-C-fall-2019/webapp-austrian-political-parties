             <h2>Idea</h2>

             <h3>Website Coding in School</h3>
             <ul>
               <li>we both attend the informatics branch of the HTL Leonding, a technical high school in Upper Austria</li>
               <li>in a subject called "Webtechnik" (German for web technologies) we are given the opportunity to design our own website with the help of our teachers</li>
             </ul>
            <h3>Political interest</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>we chose to do a website about Austrian politics because we were both very interested in the topic</li> <!--I sometimes really wish that Benjamin would be as interested in website coding as he is in politics-->
              <li>we are already quite involved in the topic since you are already allowed to vote in Austria as soon as you turn 16</li>
            </ul>
           <h3>Political misinformation</h3>
           <ul>
             <li>since you are allowed to vote as early 16 we often find to be targeted by a quite lot of political advertising, even in school</li>
             <li>through our experience we have learned that a lot of people in our age group vote based on which party uses the most tax money to gift them sweets rather than which partyÂ´s points they agree with the most</li>
             <li>therefore we thought that this age group and everyone, even international, who wants to know more about Austrian politics, would need a short, handy website, on which all the needed information is stacked</li>
          </ul>
