                  <h3>Post-revolutionary Austria (1848–1866)</h3>
                  <p>
                  At the time of the Austrian-Hungary-Empire Separatist tendencies especially Hungary were suppressed
                     by military force.But after this movement a constitution was enacted in March 1848, but it had little
                      practical impact, although elections were held in June. The 1850s saw a return to neoabsolutism
                  </p>
                    <h3>First Austrian Republic (1919–1934)</h3>
                  <p>
                      After World War I and the defeat of the Austria-Hungary-Empire the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)
                        the Land of Austria was extremly reduced and the A-H-Empire was splitted in many smaller peaces. The
                        new Country (First Austrian Republic) had a doupful future. Anschluss refers to the annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany on 12 March 1934 and marks the End of the first Republic of Austria.
                   </p>
                   <h3>The Second Republic (since 1945)</h3>
                   <p>
                     In April 1945 Karl Renner, an Austrian elder statesman, declared Austria separate from Germany and set up a government which included socialists, conservatives and communists.
                     This contributed to the Allies' treating Austria more as a liberated, rather than defeated, country, and the government was recognized by the Allies later that year.
                     Austria was split in 4 Occupation zones.The Austrian State Treaty was signed on 15 May 1955. Upon the termination of allied occupation, Austria was proclaimed a neutral country,
                      and everlasting neutrality was incorporated into the Constitution on 26 October 1955.The Second Republic is the longest democratic-period Austria ever had.

            <p>In order to to make Austrian democracy more easily to understand
              you will be able to compare Austrians democracy to democratic countries around the globe.</p>
