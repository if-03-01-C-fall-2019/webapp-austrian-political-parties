    <h2>Basic Explanation</h2>
    <h3>
      Tumble Rumble is a political inspired brawling game.
      After choosing a character for each player as well as a map you have to push the opponent
      off the platform using basic attacks. Score a kill to win a round. Win 3 rounds to win the match. After each round each player can upgrade his characterÂ´s health regeneration, shield, knockback and damage stat.
      Each character has a unique visual design and unique abilities. Good luck and have fun!
